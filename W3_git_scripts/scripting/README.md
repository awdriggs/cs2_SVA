# Bash Scripting

## Pipes, &&, Redirects
- `|` (pipes) &rarr; sends the results of a command to the next command.
- `&&` &rarr; completes commands in sequence as long as there are no errors.
- `;` &rarr; also completes commands in sequence, ignores errors.
- `>>` &rarr; appends result of a command to a file
- `>` &rarr; takes the result of a command and save to a file, will overwrite!

Examples, 

1) list the files, send to cat, then redirect and store in a file.
```bash
 ls | cat > files.txt
```

2) change directory then ls files
```bash
cd somdir/ && ls
```

3) Add a Line with the redirect 
```bash
echo "End of Directory" Â» files.txt
```
 
4) Grab the Contents of a Website and Save
```bash
curl http://wttr.in/Brooklyn >> weather.txt
```

## Simple Script 
- Use `touch hello.sh` to create a new file
- Open this file in a text editor. `atom hello.sh` if using atom.
- Let's type our first script!

```bash
echo Hello World
```

- Save the file and return to the terminal.
- Try `bash hello.sh`
- What just happened? We used bash to run the script! The `echo` command just prints to the screen whatever comes after it.

### chmod (Change Mode)
- We had to use `bash` to run the file. To make the command executable, we have to change the permissions.
- Type `chmod 755 hello.sh` 
- `chmod` means change mode. The 755 is changing what the permission are. In this case it is only editable by the owner, but can is executable by anyone.
- Now we can just type `./hello.sh` and the script will run. Why the `./`? This tells bash to look in this directory for the script, otherwise it will look in the `/bin` directory and it won't be there.
- See how the permissions change...

### Variables
- Variables are placeholders for values that might change throughout the script.
- Defining Variables &rarr; `FIRST_NAME=Adam`
- Variables have to start with a number, not a character 
- Using variables &rarr; `$FIRST_NAME` 
- NO SPACES! Before or after the =
- Need spaces? `FULL_NAME="Adam Driggers"` 
  
### Parameters
- Parameters come at the end of a shell command, example `cat file.txt`, the name of the file is a parameter sent to the `cat` command.
- We can use parameters in our scripts. 
- `$0` is the file path of where the script is being run.
- `$1` is the first parameter after the command, `$2` would be the second parameter, and so on.

### Exercise 1
- Create a simple script called `likes.sh`
- Example output `./likes.sh adam coffee` will print to the terminal `Adam likes coffee`
